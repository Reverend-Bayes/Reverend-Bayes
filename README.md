## About Me

Full-stack AI engineer who builds production-grade systems that bridge models, infrastructure,
and user interfaces. I design and deploy tightly engineered, cost-effective, and transparent ML
applications across LLMs, computer vision, analytics, and research. I specialize in building
real tools that work under real-world constraints: privacy-first GenAI platforms, multi-voice
LLM agents, custom NLP systems, and field-adjacent tools that replicate the logic of proprietary
systems using open resources—tools that work well enough to solve real problems even without
corporate data, infrastructure, or scale. Experienced across nonprofit, automotive, enterprise,
and research domains.

  I build full-stack AI products that bring models into real-world use—merging UX, analytics,
  and privacy-first design. I prioritize stacks that are tightly engineered, cost-effective,
  and highly transparent. I like clean architecture and user-mesmerizing UIs (or at least
  clean, user-friendly, non-offensive frontends when strapped for time). I always code with
  the next guy in mind—even if that next guy is future me.

  My open-source projects include GenAI-native BI platforms, LLM-driven call center analytics,
  and anomaly detection tools for automotive diagnostics. These systems combine LangChain,
  GPT-4 (and GPT-3.5 when affordable token cost is a priority), semantic search, vector databases,
  custom pipelines, and real-time analytics layers using DuckDB and Altair…

  I code in Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I work with SQL, Oracle, SQL Server,
  and NoSQL databases, and routinely handle structured data in JSON. I develop UIs and full-stack
  apps using HTML, CSS, and modern frontend frameworks. My work spans classical ML, NLP, and
  LLM-based systems—from spaCy pipelines to GPT-powered tools. I track KPIs to measure impact,
  fine-tune strategies, and lead AI adoption. I build dashboards using both Power BI and custom
  frontends (React + TypeScript), and integrate them with backend analytics, cognitive services,
  and Microsoft tools like Azure Speech for richer insight delivery. I also advise on AI product
  strategy, focusing on real-world applications in business.

  🔧 **Note:** Much of my previous work lives in private or corporate repos. I’m now build
